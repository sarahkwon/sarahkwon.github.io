## How It's Made:

**Tech Used:** HTML, CSS3, Javascript, React

The project's interface was built using Chakra UI and styled with the Chakra UI's Styled System

The site is fully responsive for all devices

## Lessons Learned so Far:

The most important thing I learned here is to take my time. A couple times I found myself rushing to get everything in which, as expected, resulted in messy code. 
I tried to code everything without a plan as well because of how excited I was to bring my ideas to life, but I ended up being unhappy with how it came out. So, I had to take a step back and plan everything out, from the tools, the components, and the UI of my site. The process went smoother and I now have an end product that's simple, intuitive, yet still shows off who I am.
